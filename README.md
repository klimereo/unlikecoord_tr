## Introduction

In my master's thesis, I explored the intriguing linguistic phenomenon of coordination of unlikes. Within this repository, you can find comprehensive data, the implemented grammar, and pertinent code that I utilized throughout the entirety of this project. This README provides an overview of the resources included in this repository.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

- **acceptability-experiment**: Contains data, materials and code related to the acceptability experiment conducted for the research.

- **LaTeX**: Contains the LaTeX source files for the master's thesis document. These files can be compiled to generate the thesis document or can be used to extract linguistic examples.

- **XLE**: Includes the XLE implementation of the analysis (to be updated in future).

- **valency-dictionaries**: Includes both the valency dictionaries and the accompanying code employed in their construction.

## Acceptability Experiment

The `acceptability-experiment` folder holds both raw and preprocessed data collected from the acceptability experiment conducted as part of the research. The scripts utilized for data preprocessing and subsequent data analysis are also located here.

## XLE Grammar

The `XLE` folder encompasses the XLE implementation, accompanied by the set of test sentences employed for evaluating this implementation.

## Valency Dictionaries

The `valency-dictionaries` folder comprises the constructed valency dictionaries of respective treebanks. The Python script that automatically parsed and extracted valency information is also available here.
